# GameDevApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## API

Everything in the folder 'api' is generated by a tool named ng-swagger-gen
If changes to the Backend have been made, that tool has to be run again. 
The config is in the file 'ng-swagger-gen.json'. For the tool to generate the api, the Backend must be running and the url under which it is available must be configured in the config file.

http://{your ip or host name here}:{port}/v2/api-docs

Without the '{}'.

After running 'npm i' in this folder run the command 'node_modules/.bin/ng-swagger-gen'
